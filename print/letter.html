        <h1>Project Declaration</h1>
        <p>Since the name "Luke" was given to my by my father, I have been using it actively in replacement of the name "John". I cherish the beautiful name that was given to me with the meaning of "light", something that came in close connection with my Vietnamese name "Huy" and I have absolutely no intention to change such a beautiful meaning.</p>
        <p>However, I soon realized that the name was given to me before I had the chance to change my family name to "Nguyen Khanh". It was normal in Vietnam but in Canada where your preferred name is often asked, my name usually appears as "Luke Ha" in many documents and places. This connection is absolutely not intentional and it unfortunately remind me of the past that I want to leave behind.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the fact that I will probably change my official name will give me opportunity to change my preferred English name. I want to take this chance to change my name to something androgynous that aligns with my identity as well as making me comfortable with bearing the "light-giving" meaning that I uphold. Moreover, I would love to have a more unique name because "Luke" is a rather popular name.</p>
        <p>With that being said, I propose to adopt the name "Luka" as my English given name. Not only it will keep the original meaning of my name but also very close to my original name. The most significant difference is the fact that "Luka" is pronounced with two syllables and could be mistaken with the name "Luca".</p>
        <p>Of course, deciding on the name is the easy part. It is also about switching my presense to Luka is a bit harder, especially my online accounts. Most of my accounts are tied to lukenguyenkhanh@gmail.com, which unfortunately Google does not allow to change your email address. That means switching to another email address and then migrating my accounts to that new accounts. This also includes third-party apps and the most important: my passwords. For security, I will keep lukenguyenkhanh@gmail.com email for 6 years (double the Google inactivity limit) in order to ensure a smooth migration. Criteria for a completed online migration must be discussed before the plan proceed with what account to migrate. Another point you need to pay attention is which account gets the old name Luke and with one gets the Luka name, and change if you wish.</p>
        <p>With that being said, my official documents will need to be changed. I will need to conduct researches and I suggest you start with getting a changing name checklist from the internet. The name-changing certificate (or whatever it will be called) is the most important document you will need to keep along with your birth certificate. I personally think that officially changing your name is rather easy, but it is a hassle to changing what is <i>unofficial</i>. As you can see from the paragraph above, the preparation for changing your online presence is quite difficult because everything is scattered and undocumented. I do not know which account do I have until I need it, which is also the case for my official documents. Therefore, I highly recommend you to go through your document folder for all of the paperworks since your birth, then select out what need to be changed.</p>
        <p>Socially changing your name to Luka is not a problem, so I want to discuss the significance in changing your name to Luka and what I expect from you — my future — to uphold the beauty of that name. You see... we do not have that many selection for other name to choose from that closely resemble the name that was given to me initially. "Luke" and "Luka" is a beautiful pair and there is no other name that fits these two as a match, so in case you need to change your name again, we might have to go with other selection. Therefore, I hope you understand that I really want this name to be the final name that I will ever adopt as my official English given name. Secondly, there is a feminine intention in adopting a gender-neutral name. I hope you are much more comfortable with using "Luka" as a way to express yourself and your femboy nature. That name is also quite unique, so it is your mission to make people who bear that name to be proud to have the same name as you. I hope that when remember of Luka, they will think of a cute, nice, kind, and wonderful person.</p>
        <p>With all of that intentions, I hereby entrust Project New Light to you, my future. It could be hard but it could also be easy — I have no idea since this is only the project declaration. I hope that after this project, we will bring a new and better light to this world, luminating the path for others to follow.</p>
        <p>With hope,</p>
        <p>Luke Nguyen Khanh</p>
